# Iris Flower Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

![Iris Flowers](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Kosaciec_szczecinkowaty_Iris_setosa.jpg)

## Overview

This project implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify Iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements. The Iris dataset, a standard in machine learning, provides data for three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

## Key Features

- **Methodology**: Implemented in Python, utilizing Pandas and NumPy for data handling, and Scikit-learn for machine learning tasks.
- **Model Training**: Trains a KNN classifier with `n_neighbors=3` to predict Iris species.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Includes a confusion matrix and classification report to assess model accuracy.

## Usage

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```

cd iris-flower-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the main script to classify Iris flowers:

```
python iris_classification.py
```
